# Svelte + TailwindCSS + Snowpack

Starter template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) apps.

With built-in support for TailwindCSS 2.0 and bundling handled by Snowpack for rapid development :zap:

## Getting Started :rocket:

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
npx degit AGS1130/svelte-tailwind-boilerplate my-project

# Change directory
cd my-project

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm run dev
```

This will automatically start the dev server for Snowpack and open a browser in [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised (production) version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
